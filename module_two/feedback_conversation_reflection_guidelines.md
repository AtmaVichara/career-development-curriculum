* Date of feedback conversation: 10/12/2017

* How did you prepare for the conversation? 
Reflecting over the project and how each person participated in the project.

* How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? 
I had a great group to work with on this project.
Working in a larger group, communication is always a concern; however, we communicated really well.
Giving feedback was easy because after working together and communicating through our project we were able to communicate our feedback as well.
We each talked about what went well, why it was successful, and the parts we agreed we could imrpove on.
It was a good retro because we were able to acknowledge the good as well as the bad.

* What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?
Appreciation and Coaching
