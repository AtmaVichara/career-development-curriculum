### Before the Session
* Update SLIDE _____ with the new PD Peer Groups
* Decide on how to model the 7 strategies for overcoming barriers. There are suggestions listed below, but it will be helpful if you come up with any scenarios you're willing to share from your own job searches. This is a way that we as staff can share our stories with students and help them to make connections. Specifically, you'll need to model:
  * Imagining that you can't fail at the job search/have unlimited resources -- what would you try?
  * Discuss what you've done in the past to help you overcome barriers in your job search
  * Brainstorm a few options based on your StrengthsFinder strengths and [domains of leadership](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N449kYbcOhu22vbORfjUOfjFOIfPoka5w00q_fklipU/edit?usp=sharing)
  * Name a worst-case scenario -- what's the worst thing that could happen?
  * What would happen if you intentionally did the thing that you're afraid of?
  * Use a hypothetical that illustrates the exact opposite of the thing that you fear the most (what if this actually turned into something great? How does that change the situation?)
  * Find the underlying motivation for embarking on a job search in a new field -- link it back to the practicalities (not just the dreams) of what this new career means, such as higher income, support family better, greater work-life balance, intellectual stimulation, ability to make a difference on a real scale, etc.
