| Opening (12 mins)                 | Using Slides 3-5, read through the objectives and expectations for PD in Module 4. After discussing the deliverables, provide students with 3-5 minutes to read through the 30-day plan template (post this in their channels) and see if they have any questions. After answering questions for 2-3 minutes, move to slide 6 to introduce the concept of PD Peer Groups and discuss the expectations using [this doc](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/guidelines_for_peer_groups.md), which you should also post in their channels. Give students 2-3 minutes to look through those guidelines and again 2-3 minutes to ask any questions about the expectations of PD Peer Groups and the coaches. After you've covered how the module will be structured, move to the next discussion...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Students follow along, read through plan when directed, take notes if needed |
| Barriers (10 mins)                | Using Slide 8, introduce the idea of barriers and say: **"Job searching can be uncomfortable and create a lot of insecurity. In fact, we can sometimes talk ourselves out of opportunities before we even give them a chance. When we do that, we create our own barriers to success."** Read through the examples on the slide, and discuss how you might move past each barrier -- for the first one, you might say: **"Often, job descriptions are written by hiring managers or someone else who doesn't actually know what the job needs. They might think writing 3-5 years' experience or CS degree will help them find the person who can do the job, but what we know is that if you can demonstrate that you can do the job well, you're a viable candidate. Apply to the job anyway and use the opportunity to show your projects."** For the second one, you can mention how **"there are many ways to network, such as blogging, engaging in social media, or make meetups less scary by attending with a friend and pre-planning 1-2 people you could speak with."** For the third one, discuss that **"there are many opportunities to practice interviewing this module through mock interviews with instructors, Jeff, and mentors."** And for the fourth one, reinforce the idea that structuring a job search according to your highest priorities will help you find what you want more quickly. You can also solicit responses from students on how they would move past a specific barrier. Then, using slides 9 and 10, have students reflect individually in their journals for 5-6 minutes on the barriers that may come up for them in their job search. They should be ready to share these with their PD Peer Groups later.  | Students participate with responses; students write in their journals.       |
| Outreach (15 mins)                | Using slide 12, introduce the next topic of outreach and say: **"As we've discussed, the number #1 strategy we're going to encourage you to take on in your job search is to pursue relationships over applications. You do this through outreach. Whether it's 'warm' outreach in which you utilize your existing network or 'cold' outreach in which you initiate contact with someone you haven't met yet, building relationships with others in the technology industry will help you get your foot in the door faster than if you merely submit your resume to online application portals."** Switch to slide 13 and say: **"Let's learn from an alum's experience."** Share Jesse's blog post in the cohort channels and have students read the post for 6-7 minutes and instruct them to make notes using the questions on the slide. Then, have students pair up to discuss takeaways for 5 minutes. After wrapping the discussion, take 2-3 minutes for a few groups to share out answers to these questions: **"What value is there in using outreach as a job search strategy? What are some ways that you will adapt Jesse's approach in your job search?"**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Students follow along, read blog post, and then participate in discussion    |
| Networking & Branding (12 mins)   | Switch to slide 14 and say: **"Another strategy for you to continue to focus on this module is networking, and this take different forms. What are some ways you can participate in networking?"** Solicit answers from students; possible answers: *go to meetups, share blog posts, etc.* Then using slide 15, say: **"We've discussed the power of storytelling, and this is something you'll continue to practice with your groups. Let's look at what the payoff can be for effective storytelling as described by two different alumni in their job searches."** Then play the clips of the podcasts for the students, and then have them get into groups of 3-4 people to discuss the questions on the slide for 5 minutes. With the remaining 1-2 minutes, have a few groups share out their takeaways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Students participate in discussions, listen to podcasts                      |
| Technical Interview Prep (8 mins) | Using Slide 16, remind students about the opportunities they'll have to practice technical interview skills. Then have students reflect individually in their journals on the questions on the slide for 5-6 minutes. If there is time, you can have a few students share out strengths and weaknesses with the purpose of helping others identify who to go to for help and how they could study together to help with the same weaknesses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Students reflect, then share                                                 |
| Break into groups (2 mins)        | Using slide 18, remind students about the resources they have for their peer groups, and with slide 19, have them find their groups and begin introductions/DTR with each other. Remind them of the guidelines for providing structure for their groups (link is in slide 18 as well).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Students find their groups                                                   |
