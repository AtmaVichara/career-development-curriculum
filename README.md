Three years ago I got away from a lot that was bad in my life, and three years ago I started programming, and I don't think either one could have happened without the other.  Immediately, programming was something I loved to do that wasn't poison.  And before long, it let me have a vision of a good future after years of feeling hopeless.  And when something to run _from_ meets something to run _to_, it turns out you can run pretty fast.

I learned a lot studying on my own, but my knowledge was so scattered that it added up to less than the sum of its parts.  I saved up a little money at my little sales job and applied to Turing School.  Turing gave me the direction I needed, taught me all the related skills like collaboration and expressiveness that I couldn't learn at home, and helped me unlearn all the bad habits that form when you practice without feedback.

Now, I'm confident that I'll graduate Turing School with not only a solid portfolio, but also solid knowledge to back it up.  I intend to find a stable career than can finance my paying off my loans.
